Problem Statement: Predicting House Prices with Simple Linear Regression

Background:
As a data scientist working for a real estate agency, you have been tasked with building a predictive model to estimate house prices based on a single feature: the square footage of the house. The dataset provided contains information on 100 houses with only two columns: "SquareFootage" and "HousePrice."


Task:
Your task is to develop a simple linear regression model that predicts house prices solely based on the square footage of the house.


Dataset:
The dataset includes information on 100 houses with the following columns:

SquareFootage: The square footage of the house.
HousePrice: The target variable, representing the price of the house.


Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the relationship between square footage and house prices.
Visualize the data to identify any patterns or trends.

Data Preprocessing:
Check for any outliers or anomalies in the data.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Linear Regression:
Implement a simple linear regression model using the square footage as the independent variable.
Train the model on the training set.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.
Analyze the regression coefficients and interpret their significance.

Prediction:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen square footage data.


Deliverables:
A well-documented Jupyter notebook or code file detailing the EDA, data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
Visualizations depicting the relationship between square footage and house prices.
A trained simple linear regression model capable of predicting house prices based on square footage.
Recommendations and interpretations based on the model's results.
